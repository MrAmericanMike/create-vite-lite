# Create Vite Lite

> # **WORK IN PROGRESS**

---

> ## What is this package?

The idea of this package is to provide Vite like Scaffolding for different Frameworks.

---

> ## Why no use create-vite?

Please feel free to use [create-vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-vite). This lite version is meant to provide you with an ever leaner template.

---

> ## Why this package exists?

I decided to make this package so when I start a project that will use Vite it comes scaffolded in the way I like to set up the projects. Check the templates folder on the repository to see how they will look.
This scaffolds also come with a `vite.config.js` Something that create-vite doesn't provide. It also sets different ports, custom output directory and few more things.

> ## Notice

Typescripts settings follow Vite templates for the most part, with some minor changes. Please feel free to suggest changes.

---

> ## Can we contribute?

Sure, open an [issue](https://github.com/MrAmericanMike/create-vite-lite/issues) we will take a look at it.

---

> ## What Frameworks?

We will be adding more Frameworks. As for now it only includes **Vanilla**, **Lit** and **Svelte**
